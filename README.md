Note:

First, we create a local environment.
for that,
open anaconda prompt from the windows -> conda create -n carprediction python=3.7
here it will list down the list of packages present and if we need any other packages for the project, then we have to do pip install...
carprediction -> is an envi name.

Once I create an environment, we have to activate it to work inside it.

Cmd:   activate carprediction

Then go to the project location path -> jupyter notebook



if you dont find the environment that you were working:
conda info --envs
it will list down all the envi for you.
